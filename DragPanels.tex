DragPanels demonstrates how to make widgets that support click, double-click, drag-and-drop
and context menus in Morphic. This is shown with a color panel and an avatar panel.
Morphic is a powerful graphics environment, used in Self, Squeak, Cuis and Pharo.

\section{A color and avatar panel}

\label{1stIteration}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The first iteration (Figure \ref{1stIteration})  shows two panel windows that
stay in front of other windows. They can be moved around  by dragging
the title bar part. The plus symbol can be clicked to add new elements
to the panel. Each element is a square of 30*30 pixels. An element can 
start a drag action where a copy of the element is dragged to a Morph that
wants to receive it. The default action for dragging a color is setting the color
of the Morph, for dragging an avatar it is setting the email.
